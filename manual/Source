<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>Windows&nbsp;Keys</cite> is a utility to make it easier to use the <cite>MS&nbsp;Windows</cite> specific keys under RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4. Although the new OS recognises the keys, there is no easy way to use them. Some applications, such as <cite>Zap</cite>, will support them but in general there is no easy way to get them to do anything.

<cite>Windows&nbsp;Keys</cite> allows star commands to be attached to the <key>windows</key> and <key>menu</key> keys, for all of the <key>shift</key> and <key>ctrl</key> combinations. These cam be used to launch applications, open directories or almost anything else.

</chapter>





<chapter title="Installation" file="Install">

<cite>Windows&nbsp;Keys</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4 or later. It is 26/32 bit neutral and should be compatible with RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;5 &ndash; although note that this version of the OS already contains very similar functionality as standard.

To install <cite>Windows&nbsp;Keys</cite>, copy the <file>WinKeys</file> module to a suitable place and double-click on it to run. If you want it to run on startup, the module should be placed in your boot sequence: this can be done by copying it into the <file>Choices:Boot.Tasks</file> directory or including it in the Run list in Select&rsquo;s <cite>Configure</cite> application.

The <file>!WinKeys</file> application allows the key combinations to be easily configured. It can be run on its own, but is intended to be used as a plugin to <cite>Configure</cite>. To install as such, copy it into the <file>!Boot.ROxxxHook.Res.Configure</file> directory for your version of RISC&nbsp;OS; there will now be a <icon>WinKeys</icon> option in the main <cite>Configure</cite> window, although the machine may need to be re-booted for all the icons to appear correctly.

</chapter>




<chapter title="Setting Up the Keys" file="Configure">

To set the keys, click on the <icon>WinKeys</icon> option in <cite>Configure</cite> (or double click on <file>!WinKeys</file> in a directory viewer if you don&rsquo;t wish to add the plugin). This will open a window with a section for the <key>windows</key> and <key>menu</key> keys. Each has a line for every possible combination of <key>shift</key> and <key>ctrl</key> (the first, unmarked, line is for the key on its own): star commands can be entered into these, to be executed when that key combination is pressed.

Almost any star command can be used, although there are some problems. <command>*Filer_Run</command> can be a problem when used with key combinations involving <key>shift</key>. To run applications, the new RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;4 command <command>*StartDesktopTask</command> is more reliable and will not cause things to be loaded into a text editor by mistake. Watch out for applications that use <command>*Filer_Run</command> in their <file>!Run</file> files (<cite>Oregano</cite> is an example, as it calls <cite>BookMaker</cite> and &ndash; if installed &ndash; <cite>Cassia</cite>): these may need such calls changing if they are to work correctly.

Dragging objects into the fields will enter the paths automatically. If an application is dragged in the field will be cleared and the correct <command>*StartDesktopTask</command> command will be entered. If a directory is dragged in, the field will also be cleared and the correct <command>*Filer_OpenDir</command> command will be entered. For all other objects, the path of the object will be entered at the caret (or at the end of the field if the caret isn&rsquo;t present).

The various commands are stored in system variables that can be set by hand if required. These variables are:

<list>
<li>&lt;WinKeys$Win&gt;
<li>&lt;WinKeys$ShiftWin&gt;
<li>&lt;WinKeys$CtrlWin&gt;
<li>&lt;WinKeys$ShiftCtrlWin&gt;
<li>&lt;WinKeys$Menu&gt;
<li>&lt;WinKeys$ShiftWMenu&gt;
<li>&lt;WinKeys$CtrlMenu&gt;
<li>&lt;WinKeys$ShiftCtrlMenu&gt;
</list>

When run, the <cite>WinKeys</cite> module will look for an Obey file in the directory <file>Choices:WinKeys.SetKeys</file> and run it if it is present. This file should contain lines to set the variables above as required; the configure utility will automatically create this file when the <icon>Set</icon> button is pressed.

An example file might look something like this:

<codeblock>
| WinKeys Setup File
|
| This file was autogenerated by WinKey Setup.

Set WinKeys$Win StartDesktopTask Resources:$.Apps.!TechWrite
Set WimKeys$ShiftWin StartDesktopTask Resources:$.Apps.!Publisher
Set WinKeys$Menu StartDesktopTask Resources:$.Apps.!Messenger
Set WinKeys$ShiftMenu StartDesktopTask Resources:$.Apps.!Oregano
Set WinKeys$CtrlMenu StartDesktopTask Resources:$.Apps.!FTPc
</codeblock>

Note that all the applications are stored within the Apps folder on the icon bar &ndash; this is not necessary and can be changed as required.
